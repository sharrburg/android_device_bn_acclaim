The files in this directory are reuired to enable you to compile Cyanogen Mod 7 for the Nook Tablet.

To use these files you will also need to download the gingerbread Cyanogen Mod source code form Cyanigens Github.

This source when coupled with CM7 source binaries will not build you a working update.zip.  We were working on trying to get this to work but we don
t have the time or knowledge to get it working so you'll need to use one of the many boot.img with 2ndboot that are avaialble on the XDA forum.

IF you find any bugs in our files please let us know.
