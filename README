The files in this directory are reuired to enable you to compile Cyanogen Mod 7 for the Nook Tablet.

To use these files you will also need to download the gingerbread Cyanogen Mod source code form Cyanigens Github.

This source when coupled with CM7 source binaries will not build you a working update.zip.  
We were working on trying to get this to work but we don't have the time or knowledge to get it working
You'll need to use a working boot.img with 2ndboot attatched to it.

IF you find any bugs in our files please let us know.
